# Calculator for **huuuge** numbers in C++

This is my final project for the C++ programming course at ÄŒVUT FIT. My main goal was to show one of the possible applications of polymorphism and STL.

Compile and run with
* `make`
* `make run`

You may need **doxygen** and **graphviz** to compile the docs. Both can be obtained through brew on MacOS.
